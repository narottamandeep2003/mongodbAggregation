The $project stage in MongoDB's aggregation pipeline allows you to include, exclude, rename, or create new fields in the output documents. It essentially reshapes each document that passes through the pipeline, enabling you to control the structure and content of the output.

Common Operations with $project:

Include Specific Fields:
Specify the fields you want to include in the output by setting them to 1.
{ $project: { field1: 1, field2: 1 } }


Exclude Specific Fields:
Specify the fields you want to exclude from the output by setting them to 0.
{ $project: { field1: 0, field2: 0 } }

Rename Fields:
Rename a field in the output by using a new field name and setting it equal to the existing field.
{ $project: { newFieldName: "$oldFieldName" } }

Add New Computed Fields:
Create new fields in the output by applying operations or expressions to existing fields.
{ $project: { newField: { $operation: [ "$field1", "$field2" ] } } }


Combine Fields:
Combine multiple fields into a single field using operations like $concat for strings, $add for numbers, etc.
{ $project: { combinedField: { $concat: [ "$field1", " ", "$field2" ] } } }


Conditional Fields:
Use the $cond operator to add fields based on a condition.
{ $project: { newField: { $cond: { if: { $gt: ["$field1", 10] }, then: true, else: false } } } }


Include All Fields Except Some:
Include all fields in the output except specific ones by setting the fields to exclude to 0.
{ $project: { fieldToExclude: 0 } }
