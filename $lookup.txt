the $lookup stage in an aggregation pipeline is used to perform a join operation between two collections. This allows you to combine documents from different collections based on a common field. It's somewhat analogous to SQL joins.

db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",        // The collection to join with
      localField: "product_id", // Field from the input documents
      foreignField: "product_id", // Field from the documents of the "from" collection
      as: "product_details"    // The name of the new array field to add to the output documents
    }
  }
])
